First clone the repository to your local machine

```
git clone https://github.com/Anuka04/Sleepiness-Detection.git
```

Next you cd into the directory of the project

```
cd Sleepiness-Detection
```

Next (and this specific step is optional) I like to open the code in my code editor (VS Code) but you can choose to run the project from the terminal itself in which case skip this step and go ahead to the next one

```
code .
```

Now we install the Requirements

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

There is one more step to install dlib which is a toolkit for making real world machine learning and data analysis applications. \
This involves taking the file path of the dlib-19.19.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl file that has gotten cloned into your folder along with everything else.

```
pip install "your_file_path\dlib-19.19.0-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl‚Äù

The final step is to run the main file
